# 03 JavaScript: Password Generator

## Your Task

Create an application that enables employees to generate random passwords based on criteria that theyâ€™ve selected. This app will run in the browser and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript. It will have a clean and polished, responsive user interface that adapts to multiple screen sizes.
The password can include special characters. 

## User Story

```
Aa an employee with access to sensitive data, I want to randomly generate a password that meets certain criteria so that I can create a strong password that provides greater security
```

## Acceptance Criteria

1. When I click the button to generate a password, I am presented with a series of prompts for password criteria

2. When prompted for password criteria, then I select which criteria to include in the password

3. When prompted for the length of the password, I choose a length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters

4. When prompted for character types to include in the password, I choose lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters

5. When I answer each prompt, my input should be validated and at least one character type should be selected

6. When all prompts are answered, then a password is generated that matches the selected criteria

7. When the password is generated, the password is displayed on the page

**Accessibility Standards**
1. When I view the source code, I find semantic HTML elements.

2. When I view the structure of the HTML elements, I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning.

3. When I view the css and javascript files, they fall in sequential order

4. When I review the CSS code, CSS advanced features linke flexbox, media queries, and CSS variables are utilized.

5. When I review the javascript code, all the required prompts, variables, arrays, functions, if-else, for loops are appropriately used and comments added accordingly.
